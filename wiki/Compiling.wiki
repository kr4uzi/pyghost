== Windows ==
=== Preparations ===
== !! THIS WIKI HASN'T BEEN UPDATED FOR pyGHost++ v. 0.4 YET !! ==
Download the latest Boost Libraries, Python (> v.2.3) and Microsoft Visual Studio 2008:
<br />
 * [http://www.boost.org/users/download/ Boost Libraries]
 * [http://www.python.org/download/ Python 2.x.x]
 * [http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/ Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition]

=== Compiling the base packages ===
 # Unpack the boost libs anywhere you like.
 # Install Python
 # Install MS VC++ 2008
 # Compile the Boost libraries:
 * Start->Run->cmd.exe (or *Windows Key*+*R*->cmd.exe)
 * PUSHD "path\to\Boost\"
 * bootstrap [http://img97.imageshack.us/img97/270/compilingwindows1.jpg [screenshot]]
 * bjam --with-filesystem --with-thread --with-date_time 
 * bjam --with-python link=shared

=== Configuring Visual Studio ===
 # Open ghost.sln in .\pyGHost++\
 # Tools -> Options -> Projects and Solutions -> VC++ Directories
You can add new entries by clicking on the folder button. Enter this two paths:
 # Show directories for: Include files
  * C:\path\to\python\include
  * C:\path\to\boost\
 # Show directories for: Library files
  * C:\path\to\python\libs
  * C:\path\to\boost\stage\lib
=== Compiling pyGHost++ ===
 # Click on Release MySQL in the top middle (if you dont know what MySQL is, select only Release)
 # Right click "ghost" on the left side and select "Compile"
 # Navigate to .\pyGHost++\Release MySQL (or .\pyGHost++\Release if you selected this compile option in Step 1)
 # Copy the file ghost.exe there to .\pyGHost++ and overwrite the existing one
 # All done :)

== Linux ==
Installing pyGhost on linux requires all the same libraries as GHost++, in addition to
Python 2.6 (or greater, but not 3). This guide was written using, http://www.codelain.com/forum/index.php?topic=7941.0 as a reference, and is intended for debian-style pcs, although compiling on non-debian distributions follows the same steps (but with different package names). Important requirements are boostlibs and python2.6, war3patch.mpq, war3.exe, etc.
Also the README.txt includes a short description of how to compile under linux
===Required Packages===
{{{
sudo aptitude install build-essential g++, libmysql++-dev libbz2-dev libgmp3-dev
}}}
=== Installing Boost ===
If your distribution has versions of boost greater than 1.39, you can install them using 
{{{
sudo aptitude install libboost-date-time-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-thread-devv libboost-system-dev
}}}
Otherwise you'll have to install boost yourself (only filesystem,date-time...)
You can do this by using "wget" with the boost.org site, for example
{{{
wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.42.0/boost_1_42_0.tar.bz2/download
}}}
now, extract the downloaded files
{{{
tar xvjf boost_1_42_0.tar.bz2
cd boost*
sudo ./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=filesystem,system,thread,date_time
sudo ./bjam
sudo ./bjam install
}}}

===Installing pyGHost++===
You can get the latest version using either "wget" and a link from the Downloads page, or checkout via svn (see source page). After having unpacked the files, you need to compile bncsutil and stormlib

{{{
cd ghost/bncsutil/src/bncsutil
sudo make
cd ghost/StormLib/stormlib
sudo make
sudo make install
}}}
Now, compile pyghost itself
{{{
cd ghost/ghost/
sudo make
cp ghost++ ../
}}}
You should now have a compiled ghost, You still need to configure it to run properly, read the ghost.cfg or visit http://www.codelain.com/forum/ for more info on how to do that
